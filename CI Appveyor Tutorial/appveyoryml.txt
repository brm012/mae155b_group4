############################## EXPLANATION #####################################

Okay so this is the explanation of the YAML (yml) that is used for appveyor. This is a text document with the 
lines of code that you need to include in your appveyor.yml file. In the file above, TOXENV defines the enviroment that
your code will be run in. In this case, I have it setup to run in python 3.6 and python 3.7. 

Essentially you will copy and paste this file, and title it: appveyor.yml

If you dont want to test it in both python 3.6 and python 3.7 you can just remove py36 or py37. 

TOX:

Is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool you can use for:

	- checking your package installs correctly with different Python versions and interpreters

	- running your tests in each of the environments, configuring your test tool of choice

	- acting as a frontend to Continuous Integration servers, 
	- greatly reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing.

Basically tox creates a virtual enviroment so that appveyor can test your code in that enviroment. 

IMPORTANT: Make sure that the identation is  kept the way it is in the example above. If the indentation\
	   is off, then it will not run properly. So just copy and paste.
